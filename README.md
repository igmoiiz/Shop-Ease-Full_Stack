## 📖 Usage

### Authentication

The app begins with authentication screens allowing users to sign up, log in, or recover their password. User data is securely stored in Firebase.

```dart
// Example: Logging in a user
final authServices = AuthServices();
await authServices.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
```

### Browsing Products

Users can browse products through various categories or featured collections. The app uses Provider for state management.

```dart
// Example: Fetching products from a category
final products = await interfaceController.fetchProductsByCategory(category);
```

### Managing Cart

Cart functionality is handled by the CartServices controller, allowing users to add, remove, or update products.

```dart
// Example: Adding a product to cart
cartServices.addToCart(product, quantity: 1);
```
